# Thinking About Lifting: On Frequency, Baselines, Extra Credits, and Fallbacks

One of my greatest training decisions the last few years was to have a more relaxed and flexible approach to my training days.

Most people probably know the mindset I was previously working with, and many are still there: All or nothing, whether training or diet.

A minor slipup in diet can snowball into binging. If you don’t have the time or energy for the scheduled workout you may just stay at home, messing up the schedule for the following day.

## Part 1: A more relaxed view on frequency and volume distribution

This is inspired by Eric Helms’ view that frequency isn’t a primary variable, but rather a tool to distribute your volume.

Let’s say you have a 3 day a week program, doing 4 exercises a day. It might look something like this:

* D1: Heavy deadlift, rows, light bench, light squat
* D2: Heavy bench, light deadlift, dips, curls
* D3: Medium bench, heavy squat, pullups, overhead press

Whatever. This is just an example. You’re usually doing this Monday/Wednesday/Friday. My question is: Does it matter that Monday’s exercises are done on the same day?

Let’s say it’s Monday and you don’t have the time and/or energy for the full workout. You know you can hype yourself up for heavy deadlift, and you know once you’re in the zone you can hit the rows. Or maybe you postpone the deadlift and rows, move up the curls, and end up throwing in an extra workout on Tuesday:

* Monday: Light bench, light squat, curls
* Tuesday: Heavy deadlift, rows, light squat
* Wednesday: Heavy bench, dips

You may just end up being extra focused for the deadlift/row and heavy bench. And maybe on this Wednesday you’ll even feel like going extra hard on some flyes or triceps isolation.

## Part 2: Go when you’re ready (or a little bit before)

The Giant is a super effective double kettlebell clean & press program that runs 3 times a week.

When I ran it, I eventually started getting super loose with frequency. First I decided one rest day was enough, then I started going two days in a row when I felt like it. On two occasions I got up to 4 days in a row.

Sure, it was tough, and I needed a day without kettlebells after that, but my point here is that training frequency is more of a guideline. A program may say 3x/week, but if you can do it 4-5x/week and hit the numbers you’re supposed to, it’s obviously working just fine.

Another 3x/week program that I like is [Soju and Tuba](https://www.strongfirst.com/upgrade-your-strength-with-the-soju-and-tuba-press-program/). Same training weight, 3x/week, doing a wave of singles, a wave of doubles, and a wave of triples.

Once again I’ve done that program at 4-5x/week, while one of my friends did it twice a week. We both love the program.

Go when you’re ready to perform. If it turns out you couldn’t perform as needed you went too early; if you could, you’ve rested sufficiently, regardless of what your program says.

## Part 3: Baselines and extra credits; give yourself extra chances to win

When I did The Hydra I’d eventually do it for double kb snatch and double kb front squat as well. After that I’d follow up with some barbell work and weighted chinups and dips. At least when I felt like it - sometimes the kb work in itself was enough.

This experience has percolated in my mind for a year or so, and it’s finally crystallised enough to put it into words: Extra credits. I believe there’s great value in giving yourself options to do something extra when you’re really feeling it.

Once again I’ll use Soju and Tuba as an example. Days 1-6 you do 4x1, 6x1, 8x1, 10x1, 12x1, 14x1, but I’ve started experimenting with ways to mutate the program. I might do an AMRAP on the last set, or I might view the training weight as a baseline and ramp the weight when I’m feeling strong. So D6 with a training weight of 85kg might look like this:

> 6x1@85, 2x1@87, 2x1@89, 1@91, 2x1@85, 4@85

Or maybe you can throw in a light 3x12 after your main sets, or some extra conditioning, or some curls, or maybe 3 different chest assistance exercises. Just some ways to squeeze some extra juice out of the good days.

Extra credits can also be experimenting with new exercises. Maybe you’ve never done upright rows and might consider doing them at some point, so why not do like 2-3 sets of those?

##Part 4: Fallback plans; giving yourself less chances to lose

In many a r/fitness beginner thread you’ll find variations on this question: I’ve slept like shit/went out drinking last night/don’t feel like working out/whatever; should I go regardless? 

I’m not mocking this question. It’s a very legitimate question that highlights some fear of deviating from the program. Often a friendly soul will tell them to go regardless and do **something**. It might not be what they wanted, but it’ll be **something**.

The thing is, **you don’t always know** if it’s actually going to be a shit workout. Sometimes when I feel tired and burnt out that’s just enough to take the pressure off and hit a PR, but generally I don’t have it in me to put in the volume work with a good effort.

Expanding on the previous point, I propose this: Have a fallback plan. It may be to get some easy cardio in, hit a few decently heavy sets, or maybe you’re okay with hitting 5 somewhat hard sets of volume work.

Let’s take our lifter from part 1 who trains Monday/Wednesday/Friday: Monday went great, but they slept really poorly between Tuesday and Wednesday. So on Wednesday I propose this: Turn up, do your warmups, start warming up for a heavy bench workout. If you’re still not feeling it, do the fallback plan instead, whatever that looks like.

In this case a back workout with tons of pulldowns, cable rows, face pulls etc. might be a perfect fit, maybe some conditioning too. Do that, keep the workout short, leave feeling energized and sleep well for the next day. Turn up again on Thursday and do Wednesday’s planned workout. Friday’s workout can either be done on Friday or shifted to Saturday, or even Sunday.

OR the fallback can be the most important 1-2 exercises of the day. If you’re doing a push/pull/legs split, maybe your most important push exercises for the day are bench and behind the neck presses; the baseline includes some dumbbell flyes and triceps extensions; and the extra credits are 3 hard sets of dips and 3 sets to failure each of pushups and lateral raises. Extra credits can be one, two or all of those.

## Final thoughts

This entire post can also be viewed as an exercise in prioritising:

* Having a fallback helps you figure out what’s most important to you and your goals
* Extra credits lets you add extra stuff or experiment
* Frequency is mostly just a guideline. Moving things around lets you work around scheduling issues.

Performance on a single day runs a spectrum, and this is one way to make as much use as possible of both good and bad days.
