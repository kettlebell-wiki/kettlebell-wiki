title: "Are you squatting your swing? The Squat-Hinge Continuum with Kettlebell Ballistics"
author: Nicholas Danes

In many form checks on this subreddit, there is often claims of "squatting your swing". However, with many modern hardstyle instructors, the range of acceptable squatting in the kettlebell ballistics (swing, clean, snatch) are not so binary. From StrongFirst Elite instructors, there is an acceptable range of hinge-squat that vary for the individual \[1,2\].

Brett Jones (Director of Education, StrongFirst) has a nice article on the acceptable range summarized here where these are the extreme ends where it's not considered a hardstyle swing anymore \[1\]:

>When the shoulders are even with or lower than the hips, the hip hinge has become more of a stiff legged deadlift with too much emphasis on the hamstrings.

>When the hips drop below the knees, the hip hinge has become a squat and that isn’t the goal when performing a swing.

Brett Jones also makes the great point about structural variation in bodies. This will change how everyone's hip-squat continuum will pan out in the swing:

>Short torso, long torso, short arms, long arms (is it just me or am I bordering on a Dr. Seuss story here), short legs, long legs, and any of these in every combination possible will impact how the blueprint is adjusted. Everything — to the degree of foot turnout — is adjusted to the individual. Structure matters.

John Jeffrey Parker (SFG Elite) has a nice article really going into the weeds about the squat-hinge continuum\[2\]. I'll just leave a quote of his thesis here:

>The kettlebell athlete should experiment with higher degrees of knee bend (squatting) in their athletic hinge to find their ideal power generation zone. This applies to both single and double kettlebell movements and varies depending on the load and trajectory of the movement ie; Swings, Snatches, Cleans.

Brett Jones again in another StrongFirst article, asks if there is one type of swing\[3\]:

>Do you only have one swing?

>I know I have been guilty of this. Do you have only one swing or can you choose from different versions like the athletic hinge or RDL? Can you swing to different heights at different “power levels?” Stepping swings, hand to hand swings, and even outside the legs swings…etc., but I think you get my point.

>In the end, have a “why” behind your choices. I would choose the RDL style hip hinge to target the hamstrings in a more direct way, the athletic hinge (squat style in the research) for more general athletic transfer and training purposes, and choose the double knee extension style for kettlebell sport applications. Sprinkling in a few RDL style swings within your regular diet of athletic hinges makes good sense and provides good variety to the movement pattern. But I would not use the RDL style exclusively.

If you see a form check comment saying someone is squatting their swing and they don't hit the extreme end of hips drop belowing the knees, then it's likely a fine swing for that person's goals.
